Release Version 2.92 (10/7/2014)
Major improvements:
1. Improved the "Forbidden Tuples" constraint handling option, and set it to be default for user.
"Forbidden Tuples" specifies that the validity check is handled using minimum forbidden tuples, 
which are generated from constraints. Now, it is no longer an experimental feature, 
but a complete and stable feature for all kinds of SUTs.
Compared to "CSP Solver", "Forbidden Tuples" option works faster when given a system under test, 
which has a large number of parameters with many constraints, and strength t>=2.  
However, for some kind of system which has complex constraints, such as arcade_game_pl_fm and Gg4, 
it may take a long time to calculate minimum forbidden tuples before generating test cases.
For some system which only needs to cover a few combinations, "CSP Solver" would be faster.
Both options will not affect the resulting test set.

2. Note that, for CMD mode, "-Dconstraint=no|solver|tuples" has been deprecated, 
user needs to use "-Dchandler=no|solver|forbiddentuples" instead. 
"chandler" is abbreviation of "constraint handler" which seems more accurate.
"-Dchandler=forbiddentuples" is its default option for both GUI and CMD mode.

3. Added simplify step for intermediate set of FTs during MFTs generation to reduce space cost. 
It will greatly reduce the memory requirement of using "Forbidden Tuples" option to build.

4. Fixed a critical bug that, when using mixed strength, in order to cover some mixed relations, 
ACTS may fall into an infinite loop, since an 1-way tuple would never be marked as covered, 
though it is already covered in another 2-way combinations.

Minor improvements:
1. Adjusted some choices of words on GUI to make the meanings clearer.
2. Fixed a bug inherited from older version, so that "Forbidden Tuples" 
now can handle these enum type parameters which have only one value to choose.
3. Fixed a bug to allow relational expression with two enum type parameters in GUI constraint editor.
4. Fixed a bug that caused exception when do Import for a system with some parameter, 
which contains "Relations" as substring, such as "ExtendRelationshipEdge" in Violet.xml.
5. Fixed a bug to correctly export strength of existing test set in opened SUT.
6. Fixed a bug to refresh Build Options Window on GUI when change algo, close it and then reopen.
